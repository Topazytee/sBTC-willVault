# sBTC-WillVault: Automated Decentralized Will Execution Contract

A Clarity smart contract for **automated inheritance**, **time-locked fund release**, **multi-oracle death confirmation**, **NFT inheritance**, and **dispute resolution**. Built on Bitcoin via the Stacks blockchain, it ensures secure, trustless distribution of digital assets upon death.

---

## üìú Features

* **Multi-oracle verification** for death confirmation (decentralized control)
* **Time-locked inheritance** to enforce delay in claims
* **NFT ownership transfer** to beneficiaries
* **On-chain will hash registry** for audit/reference
* **Phased inheritance release** for structured payouts
* **Dispute resolution mechanism** with community voting
* **Emergency controls** by contract owner

## üß† Contract Components

### ‚úÖ Initialization

```clojure
(initialize-contract (oracle-list (list 5 principal)))
```

* Sets trusted oracles for verifying death
* Can only be called by the `contract-owner`

---

### üë• Beneficiaries

```clojure
(add-beneficiary beneficiary share lock-period nft-list)
```

* Assigns:

  * `share` (uint: percentage of total)
  * `lock-period` (in blocks after which claim is allowed)
  * `nft-list`: List of NFT token IDs

---

### ‚ö∞Ô∏è Death Confirmation by Oracles

```clojure
(confirm-death)
```

* Each oracle calls once
* When confirmations ‚â• `required-confirmations`, death is marked as confirmed

---

### üßæ Will Hash Registry

```clojure
(update-will-hash new-hash)
```

* Updates the document hash of the user's will
* Hash must be 32 bytes (e.g., SHA256)

---

### üí∞ Claiming Inheritance

```clojure
(claim-inheritance)
```

* Can only be executed if:

  * Death is confirmed
  * Beneficiary's time-lock has expired
  * Not already claimed
* Transfers:

  * Fungible token share (minus 2% tax)
  * Allocated NFTs

---

### üß¨ NFT Ownership Transfer

Handled by:

```clojure
(transfer-nft token-id)
```

* Called during `claim-inheritance` for each NFT

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Dispute Resolution

#### Raise Dispute

```clojure
(raise-dispute evidence-hash)
```

* Stores a hash (e.g., IPFS or SHA256) of evidence
* Marks the dispute as unresolved

#### Community Voting

```clojure
;; Uses `resolution-votes` and `dispute-metadata` to track
```

* Voters cast one vote per dispute
* If threshold (default `3`) is reached, `resolve-dispute` auto-triggers

---

### üîÑ Phased Inheritance

```clojure
(claim-phase-1 phase-data)
```

* Beneficiaries can receive inheritance in stages:

  * `phase-1-amount`, `phase-2-amount` (both percentages)
  * Enforced one-time claims per phase

## üß™ Example Flow

1. Owner deploys contract
2. Owner sets oracles via `initialize-contract`
3. Owner adds beneficiaries with shares, time-locks, NFTs
4. Oracles confirm death (‚â• 2)
5. After lock, beneficiaries call `claim-inheritance`
6. If disputes arise, use `raise-dispute`, then community votes
7. Optionally, phased inheritance via `claim-phase-1`
